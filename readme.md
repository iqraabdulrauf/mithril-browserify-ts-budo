# Mithril / Typescript / Browserify / HMR / Budō

This is a starter project for [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/), Typescript, Browserify with hot-module-replacement and [Budō](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo) local dev server for hot CSS reloading.

This project also uses PostCSS for CSS compilation.

This repo also contains a branch that performs code-splitting (separating your app and vendor bundles.)

	git checkout code-split

And a Babel branch for plain ES20XX instead of Typescript.

	git checkout babel

Note that each branch has different npm dependencies so you will need to run `npm install` for the branch you want to use.

## Install

	npm install

### Recommended VSCode Extensions

* tslint
* eslint
* stylelint
* postcss-sugarss-language
* EditorConfig

(Or equivalents for your preferred editor/IDE.)

## Run & Develop

	npm start

Then go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## Build Minified

Outputs compiled JS to `public/js` and CSS to `public/css`.
